If you want the script to work correctly, you must do this:

# 1: It is necessary to have these scripts

- pma-voice
- ox_lib

# 2: copy this code

```
    ["radiousb"]                        = {["name"] = "radiousb",                     ["label"] = "Radio hack",                 ["weight"] = 5000,         ["type"] = "item",         ["image"] = "RadioUSB.png",             ["unique"] = false,     ["useable"] = true,     ["shouldClose"] = true,       ["combinable"] = nil,   ["description"] = "USB that can be used to hack police radio channels"},
```

# 3: paste the code in qb-core/shared/items.lua
